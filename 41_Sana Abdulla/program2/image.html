<font size="10"><p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the
reproductive structure found in flowering plants</p>
<p>Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground
grain and the reproductive structure in plants,
before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of
the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was
blossom,though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.
