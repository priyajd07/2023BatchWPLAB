<strong>Facebook</strong> filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on <i> January 1, 2012.</i>[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a<mark> 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.</mark>[30]<br><br>

<em>Underwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.</em>[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] The New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a "must-own stock". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as "the next great blue-chip".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, "That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation."[35]<br><br>

<large>Trading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange</large>.[36] <small>The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.</small>[37] <del>At closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value.</del> <sup>The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.</sup>[39] <sub>The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.</sub>[41]<br><br>
