<h1> MES COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING KUTTIPURAM</h1>
<p style="text-align:right; color:blue; font-family:arial">
MES College of Engineering (MESCE) is a Kuttippuram, Malappuram-based private engineering college. It is Kerala's first self-financing engineering college, with a campus that extends for more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Bharathappuzha River. It was founded in 1994 as a minority-serving institution.
The college admits students from all backgrounds, with a special focus on educationally impoverished communities. The Fabrication Laboratory (FABLAB), the MES Innovation Centre, and the Community Development Centre are just a few of the institute's major off-campus facilities. 
The college currently offers eight undergraduate programmes, including a Bachelor of Architecture, as well as ten postgraduate programmes in Master of Engineering, Master of Computer Applications, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Architecture.
